	Abstract = {Recent research has documented that income inequality in the United States has increased dramatically over the prior three decades. There has been less of a consensus, however, on whether the increase in income inequality was matched by an equally large increase in consumption inequality. Most researchers have studied this question using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) and some studies have suggested that the increase in consumption inequality has been modest. Unfortunately ,there is now mounting evidence that the CE is plagued by serious non-classical measurement error, which hinders the extent to which definitive conclusions can be made about the extent to which consumption inequality has evolved over the last three decades. In this paper, we use a variety of different techniques to overcome the measurement error problems with the CE. First, we use data from the diary component of the CE, focusing on categories where measurement error has been found to be less of an issue. Second, we explore inequality measures within the CE using the value of vehicles owned, a consumption component that is considered to be measured well. Third, we try to account directly for the non-classical measurement error of the CE by comparing the spending on luxuries (entertainment) relative to necessities (food). This is similar to the recent approach taken by Browning and Crossley (2009) and Aguiar and Bils (2011). Finally, we use expenditure data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to explore the dynamics of alternative measures of consumption inequality. All of our different methods yield similar results. We find that consumption inequality within the U.S. between 1980 and 2010 has increased by nearly the same amount as income inequality.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we endogenize the horizontal structure of illicit drug markets. The key assumption is that the trafficker's probability of detection depends on his/her market share. We show that a stricter law enforcement policy encourages traffickers to permit competitors into the market. Increasing deterrence reduces the quantities supplied by each trafficker but also induces new entry, which cancels out the decrease in individual production at the aggregated level. Equilibrium total quantity and criminal profit are independent of the law enforcement level. },

For this purpose, we bring together novel data from a sample of individuals residing in violence-torn regions in Colombia, including some who were directly victimized and displaced during last ten years. We find that victims who suffered more severe episodes of violence are hopeless and perceive overly pessimistic prospects of upward mobility. These results suggest that shocks and traumatic experiences can shatter hopes and beliefs through psychological constraints and hinder the ability of people to recover in a pervasive way.},

The mobi- lization drew many women into the workforce permanently. But the impact was not uniform across states. In states with greater mobili- zation of men, women worked more after the war and in 1950, though not in 1940. These induced shifts in female labor supply lowered female and male wages and increased earnings inequality between high school-- and college-educated men. It appears that at midcentury, women were closer substitutes for high school men than for those with lower skills.},

@article{HoganKitagawa1985,
	Abstract = {Black teenagers living in metropolitan areas of the United States initiate sexual intercourse at earlier ages than other teenagers and have higher rates of premarital pregnancy. Ethnographic studies of black families have claimed that economic uncertainties cause young blacks to delay marriage, while many young women achieve adulthood through premarital parenthood. It is also probable that girls who grow up in a female-headed family or who see their sisters become teenage parents are more likely to accept single-parenthood as a way to achieve adult status. These studies have suggested that ghetto neighborhoods are characterized by loosely defined and enforced norms of sexual behavior and age and sex compositions conducive to juvenile deviance. These features of ghetto life make it difficult for parents to regulate successfully their children's behaviors. As a consequence, residents of ghetto neighborhoods are expected to initiate sexual intercourse at earlier ages and to have higher rates of accidental premarital pregnancy than other teens. These hypotheses have received limited support in previous demographic research on teenage fertility. In this paper, these ethnographic explanations of the fertility behaviors of black adolescents are tested, using data from a random sample of more than 1,000 black females aged 13-19 who lived in the city of Chicago in 1979. This analysis improves on previous demographic research by both measuring the total effects of these varibles on fertility and decomposing them into components due to effects on rates of initial sexual intercourse and the probability of conception among the sexually active. A nonbiasing, continuous-time semi-Markov model is used to identify the net effects of these factors on rates of initial sexual intercourse and pregnancy.},

Recently, however, several researchers have argued that the apparent negative effects of teenage childbearing primarily reflect unmeasured family background rather than the true consequences of a teen birth. To distinguish the effect of teen childbearing from that of family background, we use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and compare teen mothers with their sisters. We find that accounting for unobserved family background reduces, but does not eliminate, the estimated consequences of early childbearing. Statistically significant and quantitatively important effects of teen parenthood remain for high school graduation, family size, and economic well-being.},

While the concepts have been extended quite fruitfully to limited and qualitative dependent variable models, they have been rarely applied to hazard or duration (failure time) models. This paper develops an approach to simultaneity among hazard equations which is similar in spirit to simultaneous Tobit models. It introduces a class of continuous time models which incorporates two forms of simultaneity across related processes - when the hazard rate of one process depends (1) on the hazard rate of another process or (2) on the actual current state of or prior outcomes of a related multi-episode process. This paper also develops an approach to modeling the notion of `multiple clocks' in which one process may depend on the duration of a related process, in addition to its own. Maximum likelihood estimation is proposed based on specific parametric assumptions. The model is developed in the context of and empirically applied to the joint determination of marital duration and timing of marital conceptions. },

The decline in shotgun marriage accounts for a significant fraction of the increase in out-of-wedlock first births. Several models illustrate the analogy between women who do not adopt either birth control or abortion and the hand-loom weavers, both victims of changing technology. Mechanisms causing female immiseration are modeled and historically described. This technology-shock hypothesis is an alternative to welfare and job-shortage theories of the feminization of poverty.},

The analysis finds a robust effect of genocide on fertility, with a strong replacement effect for lost children. Having lost siblings reduces fertility only in the short term.

	Abstract = {Since the early 1980s, the econometric analysis of duration variables has become widespread. This chapter provides an overview of duration analysis, with an emphasis on the specification and identification of duration models, and with special attention to models for multiple durations. Most of the chapter deals with so-called reduced-form duration models, notably the popular Mixed Proportional Hazard (MPH) model and its multivariate extensions. The MPH model is often used to describe the relation between the empirical exit rate and ``background variables≓ in a concise way. However, since the applications usually interpret the results in terms of some economic-theoretical model, we examine to what extent the deep structural parameters of some important theoretical models can be related to reduced-form parameters. We subsequently examine the specification and identification of the MPH model in great detail, we provide intuition on what drives identification, and we infer to what extent biases may occur because of misspecifications. This examination is carried out separately for the case of single-spell data and the case of multi-spell data. We also compare different functional forms for the unobserved heterogeneity distribution.},

Se les clasific{\'o} de acuerdo con su duraci{\'o}n e intensidad. Esta caracterizaci{\'o}n de los CAI permite identificar las regularidades en la ocurrencia de los mismos. El segundo objetivo fue analizar el posible impacto sobre las principales variables macroecon{\'o}micas, tales como la inversi{\'o}n y la asignaci{\'o}n del gasto p{\'u}blico, y por esta v{\'\i}a, sobre el crecimiento econ{\'o}mico. A partir de esta metodolog{\'\i}a, el documento busca dimensionar el conflicto colombiano en el contexto internacional. Los resultados evidencian una relaci{\'o}n negativa entre la duraci{\'o}n del conflicto y la p{\'e}rdida de crecimiento anual, con respecto tanto al crecimiento de la regi{\'o}n a la que pertenece el pa{\'\i}s en guerra, como a su crecimiento de largo plazo. Otro resultado interesante es que la intensidad del mismo, medida como el n{\'u}mero de muertes, no parece incidir sobre la p{\'e}rdida relativa de crecimiento. En tercer lugar, se identific{\'o} la presencia de ``persistencia'' del conflicto; esto es, una vez los pa{\'\i}ses entran en guerra permanecen en situaci{\'o}n de conflicto por un largo periodo, {\'o}, si logran superarlo, reinciden de nuevo en conflictos cortos. La evidencia para el caso colombiano indica que los conflictos del pa{\'\i}s (vividos entre 1948-62 y 1984 y el presente) se clasifican entre los cinco m{\'a}s largos e intensos del mundo; a pesar de lo cual Colombia es de los pocos pa{\'\i}ses con un crecimiento promedio durante la guerra superior al de la regi{\'o}n, aunque inferior a su promedio de largo plazo. Si bien la p{\'e}rdida anual de crecimiento resulta relativamente baja, al considerar la duraci{\'o}n del conflicto, la p{\'e}rdida acumulada resulta significativa. Por otra parte, lo extenso de los conflictos colombianos representan una desviaci{\'o}n permanente de la econom{\'\i}a con respecto a su senda de crecimiento de largo plazo. Por lo tanto, la p{\'e}rdida anual calculada (en t{\'e}rminos de flujos) est{\'a} subestimada. Adicionalmente, el deterioro institucional derivado de la extensi{\'o}n del conflicto es significativo, lo que acent{\'u}a su efecto negativo sobre el crecimiento de largo plazo.},

	Abstract = {How do income shocks affect armed conflict? Theory suggests two opposite effects. If labor is used to appropriate resources violently, higher wages may lower conflict by reducing labor supplied to appropriation. This is the opportunity cost effect. Alternatively, a rise in contestable income may increase violence by raising gains from appropriation. This is the rapacity effect. Our paper exploits exogenous price shocks in international commodity markets and a rich dataset on civil war in Colombia to assess how different income shocks affect conflict. We examine changes in the price of agricultural goods (which are labor intensive) as well as natural resources (which are not). We focus on Colombia's two largest exports, coffee and oil. We find that a sharp fall in coffee prices during the 1990s lowered wages and increased violence differentially in municipalities cultivating more coffee. This is consistent with the coffee shock inducing an opportunity cost effect. In contrast, a rise in oil prices increased both municipal revenue and violence differentially in the oil region. This is consistent with the oil shock inducing a rapacity effect. We also show that this pattern holds in six other agricultural and natural resource sectors, providing evidence that price shocks affect conflict in di?erent directions depending on the type of the commodity.},

@article{Bijwaard2008,
	Abstract = {In this article we develop an Instrumental Variable estimation procedure that corrects for possible endogeneity of a variable in a duration model. We assume a Generalized Ac- celerated Failure Time (GAFT) model. This model is based on transforming the durations and assuming a distribution for these transformed durations. The GAFT model encom- passes two competing approaches to duration data; the (Mixed) Proportional Hazard (MPH) model and the Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model. The basis of the Instru- mental Variable Linear Rank estimator (IVLR) is that for the true GAFT model the instrument does not influence the hazard of the transformed duration. The inverse of an extended rank test provide the estimation equations the IVLR estimation procedure is based on. We discuss the large sample properties and the efficiency of this estimator. We discuss the practical issues of implementation of the estimator.
We apply the IVLR estimation approach to the Illinois re-employment bonus exper- iment. In this experiment individuals who became unemployed were divided at random in three groups: two bonus groups and a control group. Those in the bonus groups could refuse to participate in the experiment. It is very likely that this decision is related to the unemployment duration. We use the IVLR estimator to obtain the effect of these endogenous claimant and employer bonuses on the re-employment hazard.

After constructing a measure to date the arrival of crack markets in cities and states, we show large increases in murder and incarceration rates after these dates. Black high school graduation rates also decline, and we estimate that crack markets accounts for between 40 and 73 percent of the fall in black male high school graduation rates. We argue that the primary mechanism is reduced educational investments in response to decreased returns to schooling.},

	Abstract = {This paper borrows from the tradition of other social sciences in considering the impact that ``culture'' (broadly defined as the economic and social environment in which the poor live) plays in determining early, non-marital childbearing.  Along with others before us, we hypothesize that the despair and hopelessness that poor, young women may face increases the likelihood that they will give birth at an early age outside of marriage.  We derive a formal economic model that incorporates the perception of economic success as a key factor driving one's decision to have an early, non-marital birth. We propose that this perception is based in part on the level of income inequality that exists in a woman's location of residence. Using individual-level data from the United States and a number of other developed countries, we empirically investigate the role played by inequality across states in determining the early childbearing outcomes of low socioeconomic status (SES) women. We find low SES women are more likely to give birth at a young age and outside of marriage when they live in higher inequality locations, all else equal.  Less frequent use of abortion is an important determinant of this behavior.  We calculate that differences in the level of inequality are able to explain a sizable share of the geographic variation in teen fertility rates both across U.S. states and across developed countries.},

	Abstract = {For more than 30 years Colombia has waged an internal War on Drugs with the support of the international community. During this time, the illegal economy has evolved toward integrating cultivation with processing and trafficking, making Colombia the largest grower of coca in the world. The environmental impact of coca production and processing is vast, accounting for large quantities of toxic chemicals directly dumped onto the soil and watersheds, as well as most deforestation since the 1990s. The policies pursued to stem the coca economy, however, are based on unfounded assumptions about the behaviour of coca growers in the context of international markets. Despite their unfounded premises, these assumptions have acquired a mythical stature. In this article we review the most persistent myths about coca production with a view to understanding its links to environmental degradation. To this end, we present data on the economic and demographic background of coca growers, their impact on the environment, and their behaviour in the larger context of international markets and current eradication policies.},

A new type of bargaining failure due to multiple types of potential con.icts (and hence multiple threat points) is identified. The theory predicts conflict to be more likely when the geographical distribution of natural resources is uneven and when a minority group has better chances to win a secessionist rather than a centrist con.ict. For sharing rents, resource proportionality is salient in avoiding secessions and strength proportionality in avoiding centrist civil wars. We present empirical evidence that is consistent with the model.},

	Abstract = {In most developing countries, income inequality tends to worsen during initial stages of growth, especially in urban areas. The People's Republic of China (PRC) provides a sharp contrast where income inequality among urban households is lower than that among rural households. In terms of inclusive growth, the existence of income mobility over a longer period of time may mitigate the impacts of widening income inequality measured using crosssectional data. We explore several ways of measuring income mobility and found considerable income mobility in the PRC, with income mobility lower among rural households than among urban households. When incomes are averaged over 3 years and when adjustments are made for the size and composition of households, income inequality decreases. Social welfare functions are posited that allow for a trade-off between increases in income and increases in income inequality. These suggest strong increases in well-being for urban households in the PRC. In comparison, the corresponding changes in rural households are much smaller.},

    The paper presents a simple dynamic model of childbearing and housing demand incorporating imperfect fertility control, which suggests that early childbearing can have long-term effects on housing demand. An IV estimate of the effect of early childbearing on the probability of owner-occupation at age 30, based on information about miscarriages from the British Cohort Study 1970 data, indicates a large negative effect, and suggests that it is acceptable to treat the age-at-first-birth indicators as exogenous. Housing demand equations are estimated using data from the British Household Panel Survey 1991-2001, and these indicate that births early in adulthood substantially reduce housing demand later in life.},

	Abstract = {Despite significant progress in its path towards Europeanisation over the last two decades, Greece's reform record remains highly problematic. Persistent reform failures and a continuum of half-way reforms have characterised much of the country's recent history. In this paper we depart form dominant explanations in the literature that focus predominantly on the political and social context (lack of political will, fragmentation of organised interests, extent of rentseeking, etc) and instead focus on the processes shaping the content of reform proposals. We identify an inherent deficiency in the country's reform technology, linked to a deficient engagement of policy-making with expert knowledge (encompassing all aspects of knowledge production, processing and utilisation), which results in continuous policy-learning failures and, ultimately, inefficient reforms. Our analysis calls for a re-direction of emphasis from the study of how actors contest reforms to the pathologies that lead to the production of contestable reform proposals.},

We find that women living in clusters accounting for a larger proportion of sibling deaths in 1994, the year of the genocide, were more likely to marry later and have children later compared with those living in clusters accounting for a lower proportion of sibling deaths. Women living in regions with higher levels of under-five mortality were more likely to have their first child earlier compared with women living in regions with lower infant mortality. The age at marriage was probably affected by two reasons: the change in age structure and sex ratio of the population following the genocide, and the breakdown of kinship in the case of women who lost their siblings.},

We show that rising longevity reduces fertility but raises saving, schooling time and the growth rate at a diminishing rate. Cross-section analyses using data from 76 countries support these propositions: life expectancy has a significant positive effect on the saving rate, secondary school enrollment and growth but a significant negative effect on fertility. Through sensitivity analyses, the effect on the saving rate is inconclusive, while the effects on the other variables are robust and consistent. These estimated effects are decreasing in life expectancy.},

	Abstract = {
    We develop a model of fertility choice by utility maximizing households, based on an explicit notion of intergenerational external effects. In contrast to previous economic literature, we assume that the external effects run from children to parents. This gives rise to a fundamentally different reason for bearing of children, as parents expect to be cared for, at least partially, by their children in their old age. We take the behavior of infant mortality since 1541 as the key exogenous variable and endogeneize the size of the transfer from children to parents by linking it to the endogenous savings and fertility choice of the parents. This generates a dynamic model of a Malthusian society that performs substantially better, qualitatively and quantitatively, than previous economic models of endogenous fertility. },

I incorporate the retirement decision into a version of Ben-Porath's (1967) model and find that a necessary condition for this causal relationship to hold is that increased life expectancy will also increase lifetime labor supply. I then show that this condition does not hold for American men born between 1840 and 1970 and for the American population born between 1890 and 1970. The data suggest similar patterns in Western Europe. I end by discussing the implications of my findings for the debate on the fundamental causes of long-run growth.},

It demonstrates that work experience strongly increases the rate of entry into parenthood in Norway, a result which has not appeared clearly in previous investigations in other countries. Moreover, the analysis confirms that longer time spent in school is an important explanation for the rising age at first birth. The birth intensity for a single woman decreases as her educational level and income potential improve. Apart from that, variables related to current or prospective women's wages seem to be unimportant. These results suggest that wealth accumulation deserves a central position in the theoretical models, and throw doubt on the notion that costs of childbearing are high for women with a high earning potential.

The child-timing decision is treated as a multi-period planning problem in which the date of first birth influences both the mean and the dispersion of the household's intertemporal income distribution. Couples are assumed to use capital markets and the timing of childbirth to smooth life-cycle consumption. Optimal timing is shown to depend upon the rate at which job skills depreciate during unemployment, the wife's pre-marital work experience, the opportunity costs of completing a family, and the mean and dispersion of the husband's intertemporal earnings profile. The theory is tested with statistics drawn from the National Longitudinal Surveys. The results strongly support those theoretical hypotheses that can be tested and offer insights into timing patterns. If the upsurge in women's labour force participation and educational involvement continue, our work implies that there will be a marked economic incentive to delay childbearing.},

	Abstract = {In this article, we consider the evolution of the post-age-60 mortality curve in the United Kingdom and its impact on the pricing of the risk associated with aggregate mortality improvements over time: so-called longevity risk. We introduce a two-factor stochastic model for the development of this curve through time. The first factor affects mortality-rate dynamics at all ages in the same way, whereas the second factor affects mortality-rate dynamics at higher ages much more than at lower ages. The article then examines the pricing of longevity bonds with different terms to maturity referenced to different cohorts. We find that longevity risk over relatively short time horizons is very low, but at horizons in excess of ten years it begins to pick up very rapidly. A key component of the article is the proposal and development of a method for calculating the market risk-adjusted price of a longevity bond. The proposed adjustment includes not just an allowance for the underlying stochastic mortality, but also makes an allowance for parameter risk. We utilize the pricing information contained in the November 2004 European Investment Bank longevity bond to make inferences about the likely market prices of the risks in the model. Based on these, we investigate how future issues might be priced to ensure an absence of arbitrage between bonds with different characteristics.},

In our approach, the sex ratio in the marriage market and the rules governing divorce are examples of ``distribution factors.'' These factors are defined as variables that affect the household members' bargaining position but not preferences or the joint budget set. We extend the collective labor supply model developed by Chiappori to allow for distribution factors. We show that our model imposes new restrictions on the labor supply functions and eases the identification of individual preferences and the intrahousehold decision process. The model is estimated using PSID data for the year 1988. Our results do not reject the restrictions imposed by the model. Also, the sex ratio and divorce laws deemed favorable to women are found to affect labor supply behavior and the decision process in the directions predicted by the theory and to have sizable effects.},

But the observed association between sex ratios and social and economic conditions may be confounded by omitted variables and reverse causality. This paper uses variation in immigrant flows as a natural experiment to study the effect of sex ratios on the children and grandchildren of immigrants. The flow of immigrants affected the second-generation marriage market because second-generation marriages were mostly endogamous, i.e., to members of the same ethnic group. The empirical results suggest that high sex ratios had a large positive effect on the likelihood of female marriage, and a large negative effect on female labor force participation. Perhaps surprisingly, the marriage rates of second-generation men appear to be a slightly increasing function of immigrant sex ratios. Higher sex ratios also appear to have raised male earnings and the incomes of parents with young children. The empirical results are broadly consistent with theories where higher sex ratios increase female bargaining power in the marriage market.},

Using Current Population Survey and Census data for 2000, 1990, and 1980, we estimate these effects in a collective household framework. We find that a higher relative shortage of comparably educated women in the couple's metropolitan area reduces wives' labor supply and increases their husbands'. The impact is stronger for couples in higher education groups but not significant for high school graduates. Results are similar across decades. No such effects are found for unmarried individuals\&quot;. (\&quot;JEL\&quot; D1, J22) Copyright (c) 2008 Western Economic Association International.},

	Abstract = {In 2001, use of the STRIDE data base for the purposes of analyzing drug prices and the impact of public policies on drug markets came under serious attack by the National Research Council (Manski et al., 2001; Horowitz, 2001).   While some of the criticisms raised by the committee were valid, many of the concerns can be easily addressed through more careful use of the data. In this paper, we first disprove Horowitz's main argument that prices are different for observations collected by different agencies within a city.  We then revisit other issues raised by the NRC and discuss how certain limitations can be easily overcome through the adoption of random coefficient models of drug prices and by paying serious attention to drug form and distribution levels.  Although the sample remains a convenience sample, we demonstrate how construction of city-specific price and purity series that pay careful attention to the data and incorporate existing knowledge of drug markets (e.g. the expected purity hypothesis) are internally consistent and can be externally validated.  The findings from this study have important implications regarding the utility of these data and the appropriateness of using them in economic analyses of supply, demand and harms.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a finite horizon job search model that is econometrically implemented using all of the restrictions implied by the theory. Following a sample of male high school graduates from the youth cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys from graduation to employment, search parameters such as the cost of search, the probability of receiving an offer, the discount factor, and those from the wage offer distribution are estimated. Reservation wages and offer probabilities are estimated to be quite low. Simulations are performed of the impact of the parameters on the expected duration of unemployment. For example, it is estimated that an offer probability of unity, as opposed to the estimate of approximately only one per cent per week, would reduce the expected duration of unemployment from 46 weeks to 20 weeks.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops a simple model of the war against illegal drugs in producer and consumer countries. Our analysis shows how the equilibrium quantity of illegal drugs, as well as their price, depends on key parameters of the model, among them the price elasticity of demand, and the effectiveness of the resources allocated to enforcement and prevention and treatment policies. Importantly, this paper studies the trade-off faced by drug consumer country`s government between prevention policies (aimed at reducing the demand for illegal drugs) and enforcement policies (aimed at reducing the production and trafficking of illegal drugs in producer countries). We use available data for the war against cocaine production and trafficking in Colombia, and that against consumption in the U.S. in order to calibrate the unobservable parameters of the model. Among these are the effectiveness of prevention and treatment policies in reducing the demand for cocaine; the relative effectiveness of interdiction efforts at reducing the amount of cocaine reaching consumer countries; and the cost of illegal drug production and trafficking activities in producer countries.},

@article{Rasul2006,
	Abstract = {This paper develops a model of search and learning in marriage markets to analyze how a liberalization of divorce laws affects marriage market outcomes. In particular we analyze how the move from mutual consent divorce to unilateral divorce affects marriage rates, the composition of those who marry, and divorce rates, under the assumption that households cannot reach Coasean bargains. The analysis highlights the distinction between the effects on the existing stock of married couples (a pipeline effect) and the effects on newly married couples (a selection effect). Although unilateral divorce laws increase divorce rates for those already married at the time of the law change, the change to unilateral divorce can cause those married to be better matched than those previously married under mutual consent divorce laws. Hence a change to unilateral divorce can cause a fall in the steady-state divorce rate. The results help interpret and reconcile much of the current empirical literature in this field.},

	Abstract = {Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, this study examines the relationship between several outcomes in early adulthood (e.g. education, inactivity, earnings and health) and being born to a teenage mother. Besides standard cross-sectional multivariate regression estimates, we also present evidence from non-parametric estimates and from estimates that account for unmeasured family background heterogeneity by comparing siblings born to the same mother who timed their births at different ages. Regardless of the econometric technique, being born to a teenage mother is usually associated with worse outcomes. An important channel of transmission of this adverse effect is childhood family structure, which plays a more powerful role than childhood family poverty. Albeit smaller, some of the detrimental effects are also found for children of mothers who gave birth in their early 20s.},

The prior welfare participation of a teenage daughter's mother, the other economic circumstances and stressful events are all important aspects in the analysis, which employs a bivariate probit model. Among the many findings of the investigators is that teenage daughters whose mothers have more education are less likely to give birth out of wedlock, that teens whose mothers received welfare are more likely to give birth out of wedlock and receive welfare themselves, and that teens who grew up in a home experiencing stressful events (e.g., parental separation, geographic moves) are more likely to give birth out of wedlock.},

Some indicators of state welfare policy appear to influence the behavior of blacks and whites.

The estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions on the moments of the unobserved heterogeneity, and a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance is available. A Monte Carlo study indicates that the asymptotic distribution of the estimator provides a good approximation to the finite sample distribution. It is illustrated that the estimation strategy can be extended to a model with regressors and to a log-logistic model with unobserved heterogeneity. The main advantages of the estimator are that it is easy to calculate and that its asymptotic distribution can be derived.},
