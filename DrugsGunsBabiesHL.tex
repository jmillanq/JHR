	\textbf{Drugs, guns and early motherhood in Colombia} \\
	\textbf{Jaime Mill\'an-Quijano} \\ \\

	\textbf{Highlights:}

	\begin{itemize}
		 \item I estimate the causal effect of homicides at municipality level on the prevalence of teenage pregnancy in Colombia.
		 \item I instrument homicide rates using the interaction between the international prices of cocaine and the potential internal cocaine trafficking network.
		 \item I find that when homicides increase  the probability of young pregnancy and marriage rises. 
		 \item Adult male homicides have a stronger effect on the likelihood of early motherhood. 
	\end{itemize}
